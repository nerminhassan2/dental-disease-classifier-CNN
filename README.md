# Dental Disease Classifier
## Project Overview
The DentalDiseaseClassifier is a convolutional neural network (CNN) multi-label model developed as part of the DentaMatch project. DentaMatch is an innovative platform designed to connect dental practitioners and patients, particularly within educational and university settings. The DentalDiseaseClassifier model plays a critical role in this ecosystem by streamlining the process of categorizing dental cases based on images uploaded by patients.

## Model Description
This model utilizes a CNN architecture to analyze dental images and classify them into multiple categories simultaneously. Its multi-label classification capability enables it to identify several dental conditions in a single image, helping dental professionals assess patientsâ€™ needs more comprehensively.

## Key Features:
### Multi-Label Classification: 
The model can detect multiple dental conditions from a single image, allowing for accurate and efficient categorization.
### CNN Architecture: 
Built on MobileNetV2, the model balances performance and speed, making it suitable for mobile integration as part of the DentaMatch application.
### Transfer Learning: 
The model has been fine-tuned on a dental-specific dataset to optimize its accuracy for the task of dental case classification.
## Solution
As part of DentaMatch, the DentalDiseaseClassifier serves key functions:
### Efficient Case Matching: 
It helps dental students and professionals quickly identify patients with the specific dental conditions they need for practical experience, reducing the time and effort spent finding suitable cases.
### Improved Healthcare Delivery: 
By automating the categorization of dental images, the model significantly reduces waiting times for patients while enhancing the efficiency of dental care services within universities.
## Future Enhancements
The model can be extended to include more dental diseases as new data becomes available.
## Data Source
Some of the data used for training the model was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmansajid05/oral-diseases
## Summary
The Dental Disease Classifier is a crucial component of DentaMatch app, ensuring faster, more effective connections between dentists and patients while improving educational and clinical outcomes.
